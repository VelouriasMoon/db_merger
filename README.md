# db_merger
Tool to help with merging pv_db's for Project Diva

Usage:<br />
`db_merger.exe [-e/-b] [-pv/-itm/-gm/-obj] [db file]`

Splits pv_db, itm_tbl, gm_tbl into easy to edit modular files for each entry and merges them all back together into file.<br />

Converters obj_db into a yaml file and back to binary.<br />
